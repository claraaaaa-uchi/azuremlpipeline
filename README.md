# azuremlpipeline
This is the machine learning pipeline we constructed in Azure ML, with set up of configurations and computance environment. The pipeline is constructed with two main steps: data prep and data consuming.

#prep.py
Prep.py is where we do the feature selection and train-test split.

#train.py
Train.py is where we implement the machine learning models and make predictions. The evaluation metrics are also added in this step.
